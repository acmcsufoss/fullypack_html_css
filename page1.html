          <h1 class="questioncopy">You wake up on a rainy street, dimly lit by neon signs. 
            You walk, taking in your surroundings until a croaky voice grabs your attention. 
            <br>
            <br>
            It's an old man, wearing a dirty apron. 
            He pushes you inside his hole-in-the wall shop, shooing you into the kitchens with a list of tasks. What do you do?
          <div class="choice">
            <h1 class="choicelink">The sink is full of dishes, the floor is dirty, and the rice needs cooking.
              You roll up your sleeves with determination and get straight to work.
